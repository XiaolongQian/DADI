# DCDI
This work centers around two major limitations of MOS, i.e., the
severe optical aberrations and uncontrollable Depth-of-Field (DoF), for achieving
single-lens controllable DoF imaging via computational methods.
A Depth-aware Controllable DoF Imaging (DCDI) framework is
proposed equipped with All-in-Focus (AiF) aberration correction
and monocular depth estimation, where the recovered image
and corresponding depth map are utilized to produce imaging
results under diverse DoFs of any high-end lens via patch-
wise convolution.
The source code will be made publicly available after the paper is accepted.
