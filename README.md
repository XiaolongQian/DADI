Controllable Depth-of-Field (DoF) imaging commonly produces amazing visual effects based on heavy and expensive high-end lenses. However, confronted with the increasing demand for mobile scenarios, it is desirable to achieve a lightweight solution with Minimalist Optical Systems (MOS). This work centers around two major limitations of MOS, i.e., the severe optical aberrations and uncontrollable DoF, for achieving single-lens controllable DoF imaging via computational methods. A Depth-aware Controllable DoF Imaging (DCDI) framework is proposed equipped with All-in-Focus (AiF) aberration correction and monocular depth estimation, where the recovered image and corresponding depth map are utilized to produce imaging results under diverse DoFs of any high-end lens via patch-wise convolution.

The source code will be made publicly available after the paper is accepted.
